# Bark's History

On December, 2023

Bark Coding started out as a site simulation if 
[Scratch MIT](https://scratch.org) had a dog mascot, inspired by <a href='https://scratch.mit.edu/users/ozzy_drixAnimation'>@ozzy_drixAnimation's</a> <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/barkofficialwebsite/home'>BARK</a>

The creator, AtomicBolts started Bark in his personal computer, with poor css, since Bark was one of his first projects

A web hosting was wanted at the time, Atomic didn't hear about [Nekoweb](https://nekoweb.org/) or [Neocities](https://neocities.org/) yet.

Then Github was found and the [first commits](https://github.com/mariocraft987/bark-coding/commits/main/?after=90de7433c0df14563f3f145841f0bc53187a4bdd+2869) were made.

Bark Coding was a one person project for a while, until another developer named @qwertyytheartist (yes thats raynecloudy) applied to help with the project.

As a attempt, AtomicBolts invited @nmsderp and @dumorando (originally thepython555), creators of [Snail IDE](https://www.snail-ide.com)

More coming soon...
